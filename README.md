## 🚧 Real Problem Addressed (Indian Railways)

Indian Railways faces persistent challenges in:

- Manual identification of track fittings  
- Lack of permanent asset identity  
- Delayed fault detection  
- Human-dependent inspection processes  
- Poor traceability across asset lifecycle  

Our solution directly addresses these gaps using **laser-based QR marking, AI verification, and autonomous inspection**.

## 💡 Proposed Solution – LUMINA Ecosystem

**LUMINA** introduces a **permanent digital identity** for every rail asset using:

### 🔹 Laser-Marked QR Codes
- Fiber-laser engraved QR codes on:
  - ERCs (Elastic Rail Clips)
  - Liners
  - Sleepers
- Protected with **transparent aliphatic polyurethane coating**
- Resistant to heat, corrosion, dust, vibration, and weather

### 🔹 DRUVA – Autonomous Rail Inspection Bot
- Solar-powered autonomous rail bot
- Scans laser-marked QR codes
- Verifies asset integrity using AI
- Automatically reports:
  - Faulty component details
  - GPS-based location coordinates
- Eliminates continuous manual inspection

### 🔹 VIMARSHA Digital Platform
- Secure, role-based access for authorized railway officials
- QR-based asset lookup and verification
- Integration with:
  - **UDM Portal** (procurement & supply tracking)
  - **TMS Portal** (track management system)
- Centralized lifecycle monitoring of rail assets

## 🤖 AI & Software Intelligence

The AI module (this repository) supports the LUMINA ecosystem by:

- Classifying railway components:
  - **ERC**
  - **Liner**
  - **Clip**
- Providing a **confidence score** for every prediction
- Enabling verification of scanned assets
- Supporting real-time decision-making during inspections

The dataset consists of **150+ manually collected and annotated images**, with **hand-drawn bounding boxes** to ensure accuracy and reliability.
